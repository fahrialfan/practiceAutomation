# praticeAutomation
I have learned about automation using Katalon/Selenium/Cypress from SQA Mentor, Udemy Course, and SQA Bootcamp. This repository serves as an indication of my ability to perform automation even though I do not have any work experience related to SQA at the moment.

Currently, I have only practiced using Katalon Studio with [https://www.saucedemo.com/] as an example. I am still in the process of learning Selenium and Cypress through the Bootcamp.

Note: if you find the owner of the file called Asani, it's because I am using given devices by current company(PT. Boer Technology). Just to make sure not to create any misunderstanding and lead to suspicion it's not my work.
